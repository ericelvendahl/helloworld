                My programming background has been primarily in C++, Javascript, Java, and Visual BASIC. I've also dabbled in a lot of other things like HTML, Python, various scripting languages, most of the usual web-related suspects. I love learning new things! 
                I am typically tasked with troubleshooting technical issues wherever I am. I'm definitely the guy that people call when their computer is giving them trouble. Because of this, I am confident explaining complicated concepts to people in a way that is understandable and talking them through fixing the problem. I place creating a positive work environment at the top of my priorities.
